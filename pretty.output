Feature: Smoke Tests for Faberwork Website # features/smoke.feature:2
  As a QA engineer
  I want to run smoke tests
  So that I can verify critical functionality is working
  Background:   # features/smoke.feature:7

  @smoke @homepage
  Scenario: Homepage loads successfully        # features/smoke.feature:11
    Given the Faberwork website is accessible  # features/steps/common_steps.py:20
    When I navigate to the homepage            # features/steps/common_steps.py:61
    Then the homepage should load successfully # features/steps/common_steps.py:148
    And the logo should be visible             # features/steps/common_steps.py:155
    And all navigation links should be present # features/steps/common_steps.py:162
